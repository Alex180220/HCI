    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Following the events of the past years, the ability to host a meetings and conferences online became more than
      just
      a comodity. Before 2019 most of the meetings held by companies, schools, universities and others were held in a
      physical
      matter with everyone sitting on chairs in a big room and someone presenting on a stage with a slide show to assist
      with
      the presentation.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the 2020 Pandemic the world found itself in a position where meetings needed to be held but the
      conditions to do so were very limited. The first solution to this immediate problem were applications that
      emulate the meeting room, the chairs and the slideshow all in one place accesible to everyone from the
      safety of their home. Such applications were Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex and many more.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the #HCI 2023 Challenges I have chosen Challenge #2: Remote Communications. This document will focus on the
      analysis
      of Cisco's solution for online conferencing, meetings and more, Webex.

    <h2>Analysis</h2>
    <section id="Affordances">
      <h3>Affordances</h3>
      <p>
        Right from the main menu of the Desktop appication we can see a minimalist window, shaped similar to a mobile
        display
        with the usual Windows actions on the top of the window. The application makes it very clear with a green
        background
        button that the user can start a meeting at any point, which is the main purpose of the appication.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than that, other quick actions are available through the click of a button. Such actions perform duties
        like
        joining, scheluding and seeing the schedule.
      </p>
      <p>During the meeting on the desktop app the window is separated into 4 areas of interest:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The option bar on top specific to most PC applications with well defined categories like "Share", "Audio &
          Video", "Help" etc,
          all of those titles have an underline on the first letter being a subtle hint that the application supports
          keyboard shortcuts
        </li>
        <li>
          The main area in the center of the window which occupies around 70% of the screen. This area is supposed to
          represent
          the stage normally found on a conference/meeting held in a physical manner. The person who presents is
          highlighted while
          everyone is taking a smaller portion of the screen to let the speaker be on the center of attention.
        </li>
        <li>
          The area on the right is home to some interactive tabs that are collapsable. There are 5 tabs: Participants,
          Apps, Chat, QA
          and Notes. All of the collapsable tabs can be closed if the user desires or popped out as a floating window
          for use on a
          second monitor for example.
        </li>
        <li>
          Last area is the control bar at the bottom of the screen which extends from one side of the window to the
          other. This hotbar has
          a selection of actions represented by buttons and toggle buttons for activating certain tabs on the second
          area.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="Visual Variables">
      <h3>Visual Variables</h3>
      <p>
        The main window of the desktop application features 2 distinct areas with sharp corners, one having static
        content on a grey
        semi-transparent background with the buttons using a rounded shape and spaced between evenly with colors
        indicating
        the importance of the action and a slight hover effect for feedback. The other area has an input field and an
        list
        of upcoming meetings. The icons associated with different actions are representative and add to the ease of
        identifying
        the purpose of a specific element.
      </p>
      <p>
        The desktop version of the virtual conference room has a dark background with elements with slighly rounded
        corners. The buttons
        from the control bar keep a similar aesthetic with the same style of icons. One small difference is the font
        weight being slighly
        different.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Interaction Flow">
      <h3>Interaction Flow</h3>
      <p>
        Webex gives the user an easy time connecting to a online meeting. From the desktop application there is a input
        field
        where the meeting information should be filled in, there is also the option to join one of the previous meetings
        based
        on a history.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's just one way of joining a meeting, Webex meeting have links that are easy to share and will redirect the
        user
        straight to the app and join the meeting opening a prompt to set up input devices before taking part in the
        conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        For mobile users there is an option to scan a room code or a QR code using the phone's camera.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Presenting a Course">
      <h3>Presenting a Course</h3>
      <p>
        Webex is a very versatile platform, allowing to start a online meeting with the click of few buttons. First step
        is opening
        the application and logging in/registering. Once the user has access to their account, the next step is to click
        on the
        "Start a Meeting" button.
      </p>
      <p>
        This prompts a quick setup window which lets the user select the input devices and their state (microphone:
        on/off). When the
        user has finished setting up their devices, they can click on the "Start Meeting" button. During the first uses
        of the application,
        new user guide messages appear in the form of chat bubbles on top of actions that are of interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        After starting the meeting, everyone with the access link can enter. Usually those details are shared using
        email or other
        means of communications. After the room is created and people join, the speaker can use a variety of tools to
        present their
        ideas to the public and the application makes the process interactive by letting the audience raise their hands
        to ask question,
        express their opinion in the chat or message each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        To aid the skeaper during a presentation there is the ability to share the screen by presing one of the few
        buttons at the bottom
        of the screen. Webex also has support for 3rd party applications like anm interactive whiteboard available
        through the Apps tab
        on the right side of the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall the interaction with Webex in a academic envirement is fast and intuitive, most of the core actions
        taking no more than 2-3
        steps
      </p>
    </section>

  <section id="Webex as CLI">
    <h2>Webex as CLI</h2>
    <section id="Idioms and Metaphors">
      <h3>Metaphors and Idioms</h3>
      <p>
        On the Desktop Webex app, during conferences, the windows app metaphor with the dropdown menu on the top split
        into categories with lists is
        very aparent, with that being said while having a familiar layout, the use of a category such as "File" can be
        questionable on an app focused
        on connecting people to an virtual conference hall. This is where this metaphor fails.
      </p>
      <p>
        One interesting idiom is the mute button. Normally a button of this kind would perform the action of
        mutin/unmuting
        the user's microphone and one would assume correct but next to the button, almost embedded there is a dropdown
        toggle which brings
        a selection of quick and useful settings such as input and output devices, and settings that affect those.
        This would not seem intuitive at
        first but it would prove very useful in a handful of situations instead of navigating onto a settings window
        just to change one detail.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Text-Only Conference Room">
      <h3>Text-Only Conference Room</h3>
      <p>
        The complexity of simulating a conference room within a application may prove to be too much for an text-only
        application such as CL.
        Considering the application would still be able to transfer video/audio information from one client to the
        other and be able to present
        the shared content, an CLI application would be possible as in implementing commands for the core actions such
        as joining/start a room: join &lt;room&gt; or using the chat feature: say &lt;target&gt; &lt;message&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the actions will be encoded as commands and on the command line itself media such as screen sharing,
        video will probably not be displayed and most likely a short summary of trhe meeting would act as main elements
        for UI, a tooltip for a help command and maybe a way to see the chat in a formatted manner.
      </p>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section id="Cognitive Overload">
    <h2>Cognitive Overload</h2>
    <p>
      While doing a lot of thinks right for the right reasons, Webex can also do things wrong for the same right
      reasons. While presenting, one has the option to share the screen to the other participants. While this sounds
      completely reasonable, while sharing the screen the Webex desktop app will transform into a bar with options at
      the top of the screen. This feature has probably been implemented to prevent the application to share a view of
      itself, a mirror in the mirror scenario.
    </p>
    <p>
      While something like this can be desireable by some, it can create confusing moments as all of the actions have a
      new place, button, order and in some cases even icon.
      The bar that represents the minimised application does its best to stay as hidden as possible, which means it
      takes more actions on average to perform the same actions compared to the fullscreen experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the tabs opened will transition to a floating state and will not be visible to other participants trough
      the screen sharing.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section id="Improvements">
    <h2>Improvements</h2>
    <section id="Chat implementation">
      <h3>Chat implementation</h3>
      <p>
        The implementation of the chat feature is one thing Webex overthinked and grants the posibility to send a text
        message to everyone, the host of the meeting or any other person inside the meeting room.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this feature sounds nice on paper, all of the messages will share the same window and to send a message to
        someone specific, a user has to select the the receiver from a dropdown before sending the message.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can cause many to send messages to either the wrong person, or send messages that are meant to be private
        to everyone. This problem can be easily fixed by having the "everyone" as a tab open by default and each new
        conversation started can appear as a new tab. this was, the Chat section will act like a hub for several
        conversations that are separated from one another
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Chat implementation">
      <h3>Screen Sharing</h3>
      <p>
        The option to keep the app at the original form while screensharing would be a welcome addition since it would
        make more sense on systems with multiple monitors and for users who prefer minimizing the application manually
        and holding control over when and how to use the base features.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Design Consistency">
      <h3>Design Consistency</h3>
      <p>
        There are a few differences between different windows of the application (on the desktop version) and even more
        differences between the mobile and desktop version.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the differences are on the buttons and font, some buttons have smaller and lighter font, others have
        semi bold font, and on the mobile version the font differs completely. Some of the colors differ on the "Create
        a meting" button on desktop and mobile
      </p>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section id="Empiric Laws">
    <h2>Empiric Laws</h2>
    <section id="Fitts’ Law">
      <h3>Fitts’ Law</h3>
      <p>
        On the Desktop version of the application, the main buttons are distinguishable and have enough padding to be
        easily clickable. From the first window to the second window the relative distance is determined by the position
        of the first window. While setting up the room the buttons that are of most interent during this phase are
        aligned therefore the experience is linear.
      </p>
      <p>
        A similar experience is happening on the mobile version of the app, while on the hope screen there are 3
        buttons, there is enougn space between them to assure misclicks will not happen.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Hick’s Law">
      <h3>Hick’s Law</h3>
      <p>
        Considering the stages of the Interaction Flow, at any point of using the app, there will not be more than 3-4
        main actions/settings which can be interacted with. During the home screen the user can either Join, Create or
        Schedule a meeting. While setting up a room the user has to set up the microphone, camera and move on to the
        next step.
      </p>
      <p>
        While presenting or attending a meeting, the quantity of options is slighly higher than on the rest of the
        stages, but at this point the user has a clear purpose, to pay attention to whoever is speaking/presenting, and
        for the presenter the options are tool that can be used to enhance the experience for both the presenter and the
        audience.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Steering's Law">
      <h3>Steering’s Law</h3>
      <p>
        The desktop version does have a couple of nested dropdown menus but most of the submenus are kept minimal. While
        navigating through the menus isnt necessarily the easiest thing to do but it could have been worse. This problem
        on mobile is treated different because instead of dropdown menus, a single button opens a drawer with useful
        tools like chat, participants and a quick way to access the settings view which has fewer categories with more
        subcategories.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aproach is oposite, the first menus have very few items but the deeper you go the more option rich the view
        gets which is ideal for the mobile experience since they have the space to work with by scrolling and it limits
        the number of views the user has to go through
      </p>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section id="New Features">
    <h2>New Features</h2>
    <p>
      One useful feature can be the addition of a better chat tab. In this tab users can have multiple conversations
      opened at once separating the continuous stream of direct and public messages
